#Welcome to the my-hackernews coding challenge! 
###The goal of this challenge is to clone news.ycominator.com to the best of your abilities in React.
To get you started you can either use the create-react-app scaffold included under my-hackernews/ or however you would like.

To get started with create-react-app:
`cd my-hackernews
npm install
npm start
# go to localhost:3000`

This should pull up a ready-to-go environment!
